The Mondoo Community is a global community of DevOps and security practitioners who collaborate to share knowledge on solving the challenges of integrating security automation into every phase of the software development lifecycle, from build-time to runtime.

### We thrive on diversity

Diversity of ideas challenges us to think differently and venture into new territory to achieve the best outcomes for our businesses, for our teams, and for one another.

While we all come from diverse backgrounds, experiences, and cultural upbringings, we recognize that challenges, misunderstandings, and disagreements will arise. Disagreeing with others about technology and process can be great, as those disagreements can lead to new ideas and greater outcomes that benefit us all. At the same time, disagreements that are personal, aggressive, or make others feel attacked, are never good and have no place in the Mondoo Community.

The Mondoo Community Guidelines are maintained to ensure disagreements stay civil and do not cross into unacceptable behavior such as personal attacks or aggression against others.

Anyone is welcome to join the Mondoo Community, but in doing so you are agreeing to behave within these guidelines.

## Code of Conduct

Mondoo is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, veteran status, immigration status, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of community members at events or online in any form.

When communicating with others in the Mondoo Community, take your time, pause before posting and responding (breathe), and choose your words thoughtfully. Always be kind. Any kind of insults, whether they are sexist, racist, exclusionary, or prejudicial, will not be tolerated.

By joining the Mondoo Community you are expected to behave as follows:

- Act with kindness
- Welcome everyone
- Be open to new ideas
- Be patient

### Scope

The Mondoo Code of Conduct is expected to be followed by all employees, delegates, participants, speakers, exhibitors, organizers, and volunteers in any setting that Mondoo conducts business in.

This includes but is not limited to Mondoo Community Slack, Webinars, GitHub, YouTube or Twitch live stream, commenting on any Mondoo generated content, or threads related to Mondoo such as Reddit or Stack Overflow.

### Anti-Harassment Policy

Harassment comes in many forms, including but not limited to:

- Offensive comments related to gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, veteran status, immigration status, or religion
- Posting/Exposing sexually explicit or violent images
- Deliberate (or implied) intimidation
- Stalking or persistent following
- Intrusive or otherwise unwanted photography or recording
- Sustained disruption of talks or other events
- Inappropriate physical contact or unwelcome sexual attention
- Posting (or threatening to post) a person's personally identifying information ("doing")
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Further unacceptable behavior will result in escalating sanctions.

Exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths or similar activities are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes or otherwise create an unprofessional environment.

In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes or otherwise create an unprofessional environment.

Be careful in the words that you choose, no matter your intention with those words. Remember that sexist, racist, ageist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. If you think your conversation is making another community member uncomfortable, stop, apologize, and move forward.

For physical spaces, event staff can be asked to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your participation.

### Incident Handling

This procedure has been adopted from the Ada Initiative's guide titled "Conference anti-harassment/Responding to Reports".

All of our staff are informed of the Code of Conduct policy and guide for handling harassment, both at events as well as online. Report the harassment incident (preferably in writing) to an event or online staff member. All reports are confidential. Please do not disclose information about the incident publicly until our staff has had sufficient time to address the situation. This is as much for your safety and protection as it is for other participants. When reporting the event to our staff, try to gather as much information as available, but do not interview people about the incident. We will assist you in writing the report and collecting information.

The important information consists of:

- Identifying information (eg. name) of the participant or online member who is harassing
- The behavior that was in violation
- The approximate time and date of the behavior
- The circumstances surrounding the incident
- Other people involved in the incident

If everyone is presently safe, staff will only involve law enforcement or security at a victim's request. If you do feel your safety is in jeopardy, please do not hesitate to contact local law enforcement. If you do not have a cell phone, you can use any hotel phone or simply ask a staff member.

During in-person or online events, our staff requests that they be your first resource when reporting an incident, so that they may enforce the Code of Conduct and take quick action toward a resolution. If possible, all reports should be made directly to the team responsible, listed under Contact Information of the event.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise, unacceptable behavior should be reported by contacting any of the Community Ambassadors listed below directly. All complaints will be reviewed, investigated, and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Community Ambassadors who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

### Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Anyone who is asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

Crafting a list of punitive actions would be inadequate and incomplete. Each incident will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.

Our first response should always be to ensure the immediate safety and well-being of all parties involved. In the ideal case, an attempt to stop and prevent the violating behavior would be made before any punitive action is decided.

When punitive action is warranted, one or more of the following remedies may be used:

- Expulsion from the space or online group where the incident occurred with no refund
- Removal from the space or online group where the incident occurred for a period of time
- Banned from the space or online group where the incident occurred indefinitely
- Banned from one or more upcoming events or any of our online groups

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the Community Ambassadors will take action that they deem appropriate -- up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund, in the case of a paid event). If you have been involved in unacceptable behavior with current Mondoo community members outside the boundaries of the Mondoo Community, the Community Ambassadors retain the right to treat those external incidents in the same manner as internal incidents.

Any physical violence or intimidation, threatened or acted on, is a serious offense and will result in immediate exclusion from the community and appropriate follow-up with law enforcement.

## Community Roles

There are two defined roles within the Mondoo Community:

- **Community Ambassadors** - Community Ambassadors are designated Mondoo employees that actively participate within the Mondoo Community to welcome all participants on behalf of Mondoo, and who work to ensure community guidelines and the code of conduct are followed by all.

- **Community Members** - A Community Member is anyone who participates with the community whether in-person or via online channels, which also includes Community Ambassadors and Mondoo Employees. Community members are responsible for following the community guidelines, suggesting updates to the guidelines when warranted, and helping enforce community guidelines.

### Community Ambassador Responsibilities

Community Ambassadors are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Community Ambassadors have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, messages, tweets, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct (in letter or in spirit), or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Contact Information

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact any or all of the Community Ambassadors listed here.
